# kirby-gulp

**Getting started with Kirby 3 and Gulp**

- [Kirby CMS v3](https://getkirby.com) - a fileâ€‘based CMS that's 'easy to setup, easy to use & flexible as hell'
- [Gulp v4](https://gulpjs.com) - the streaming build system

**Table of Contents**
- [1. Requirements](#requirements)
- [2. Getting started](#getting-started)

## Requirements
- Local development server running PHP 7.1 (or later)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 8 (or later) + NPM

In order to keep everything neat, each task resides in [its own file](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles#splitting-a-gulpfile) under `tasks/`.

## Getting started
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your system, then clone this repository and install its dependencies via [NPM](https://npmjs.org):
